The remaining Document I have not started as yet.



Application:

About 90% complete now, still need to test and correct any bugs/errors

I decided on building the scanner app using the scapy library instead of trying to use Nmap.  I wanted some variety in my code and not have it all be using subprocess to invoke commands



Working On:

- Hopefully, finish the documentation by COB today

- Then moving into Bug Testing

- Then onto bash script 

- Go through assignment documentation to ensure I have covered everything I need
