Terminal Application Assignment



## Statement of Purpose and Scope

Net-Tools is a collection of IT Networking Tools and Scripts that I use almost every day.
Collated together under one application for ease of access and quick execution.
It will also be an ever-growing tool kit for testing and diagnosing networks.

Some days the old brain does not respond to coffee and for the life of me, I am unable to remember a command name or the correct arguments to use.
The internet is always at your fingertips and a quick search always nets you what you need in one to three clicks.
But even this over time becomes tedious, So I thought to myself why not just build a Python Application that houses all the network tools I need and use.

This tool is available for anyone to use. 
IT Admins, Network & Security folk I think will appreciate it most
