Terminal Application Assingment
CCC Bootcamp 2021 - Coder Academy

<br />


## Statement of Purpose and Scope

<br />

###### Describe at a high level what the application will do
Net-Tools is a collection of IT Networking Tools and Scripts that I use almost daily both work and home. 
Combining these tools into one application for quick execution and ease of use.
It will also be an ever-growing tool-kit for testing and diagnosing networks including hacking.

<br />

###### Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
It happens to us all from time to time where you forget an argument to a  command or the command itself.
Either a man page or google is usually the rescue plan, but even that at times feels tedious.
So I thought it was best I build a Python App that houses all the network tools I need and use most frequently.

<br />

###### Identify the target audience
This tool is available for anyone to use, IT Admins, Network & Security folk I think will appreciate it most.
But this is also to assist newcomers to IT and Networking or even the avid home user troubleshooting their network.
This tool is for Unix/Linux users.
Mac untested. Windows WSL2 untested. But potentially could work

<br />

###### Explain how a member of the target audience will use it
The tool required execution from a terminal CLI which will display a simple and easy-to-navigate menu system.
The user can navigate with the up/down arrows and Enter key or by using a quick key that is assigned.
Some tools will also have submenus allowing for different operations or tasks that they can perform.
