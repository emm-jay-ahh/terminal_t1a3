Terminal Application Assingment

<br />


## Statement of Purpose and Scope

<br />

###### Describe at a high level what the application will do
Net-Tools is a collection of IT Networking Tools that I use almost daily both work and home. 
Combining these tools into one application for quick execution and ease of use.
It will also be an ever-growing tool-kit for testing and diagnosing networks including hacking tools.

<br />

###### Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
It happens to us all from time to time where you forget an argument to a command or the command itself.
Either a man page or google is usually the rescue plan, but even that at times feels tedious.
So I thought it was best I build a Python App that houses all the network tools I need and use most frequently.
As I am intersted in Pen-Testing and all things Off-Sec it makes sense to build around what interests me most.

<br />

###### Identify the target audience
This tool is available for anyone to use, IT Admins, Network & Security folk I think will appreciate it most.
But this is also to assist newcomers to IT and Networking or even the avid home user troubleshooting their network.
This tool is for Unix/Linux users.
Mac & Windows WSL2 should work but currently untested.


<br />

###### Explain how a member of the target audience will use it
The tool requires execution from a terminal CLI and will display a simple and easy-to-navigate menu system.
The user can navigate with the up/down arrows and Enter key or by using a quick key that is assigned.
Some tools will also have submenus allowing for different operations or tasks that they can perform.

## Features

<br />

###### At least THREE features, describe each feature

1. Net-Tools Menu System
    - A simple interactive and intuitive layout design
    - Easy navigation up/down + enter or assigned shortcut keys
    - Future proof to handle a growing 


The idea here is to keep the interface clean and uncluttered, we are going for function over fashion.
I decided to go with "simple_term_menu" library for a terminal menu system as it seems to tick all the boxes.
The navigation is baked in but allowing hot keys assignment really speeds things up.
The documentation is solid and getting a quick demo up and running was relatively quick, 
as I had to get a feel for how it operates before committing to it.
